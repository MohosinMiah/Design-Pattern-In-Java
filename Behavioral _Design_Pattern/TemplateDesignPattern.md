# Template Method Design Pattern Example in Java

The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm in the base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

## Example: Preparing Beverages

Suppose you are building a system for making various types of beverages, like coffee and tea. You want to create a template for preparing these beverages while allowing subclasses to customize certain steps. Here's how you can implement it:

1. Create an abstract class `Beverage` that defines the template method for preparing beverages:

```java
public abstract class Beverage {
    // Template method
    public final void prepareBeverage() {
        boilWater();
        brew();
        pourInCup();
        addCondiments();
    }

    // These methods are abstract and will be implemented by concrete subclasses
    protected abstract void brew();
    protected abstract void addCondiments();

    // These methods are common to all beverages and are implemented in the base class
    private void boilWater() {
        System.out.println("Boiling water");
    }

    private void pourInCup() {
        System.out.println("Pouring into cup");
    }
}
```

2. Create concrete subclasses that inherit from `Beverage` and implement the abstract methods:

```java
public class Coffee extends Beverage {
    @Override
    protected void brew() {
        System.out.println("Dripping Coffee through filter");
    }

    @Override
    protected void addCondiments() {
        System.out.println("Adding Sugar and Milk");
    }
}

public class Tea extends Beverage {
    @Override
    protected void brew() {
        System.out.println("Steeping the tea");
    }

    @Override
    protected void addCondiments() {
        System.out.println("Adding Lemon");
    }
}
```

3. Create a client class that uses the template method to prepare beverages:

```java
public class BeverageTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Beverage coffee = new Coffee();
        Beverage tea = new Tea();

        System.out.println("Making coffee:");
        coffee.prepareBeverage();

        System.out.println("\nMaking tea:");
        tea.prepareBeverage();
    }
}
```

When you run the `BeverageTest` class, it will create instances of `Coffee` and `Tea` and use the `prepareBeverage` method to prepare them. The template method in the `Beverage` class defines the overall structure of the beverage preparation process, while the `brew` and `addCondiments` methods are overridden in the concrete subclasses to customize the specific steps for each type of beverage.

This allows you to follow a common template for beverage preparation while allowing flexibility to customize certain steps for each type of beverage.

You can use this pattern to create reusable and extensible algorithms in your Java applications.
